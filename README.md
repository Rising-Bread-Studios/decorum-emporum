**Decorum Emporium**
=======
This is a mod for [Minecraft: Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us). 

The goal is simple, to add largely varying furniture while still maintaining a high quality mod. I intend to make it compatible with as many mods as I can, so it can be slotted into any pack or modded instance.
