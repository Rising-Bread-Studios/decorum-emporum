**Decorum Emporium**
=======
This is a mod for [Minecraft: Java Edition 1.20.4](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us), using the [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net) mod-loader.\The goal is simple, to add largely varying furniture while still maintaining a high quality mod. I intend to make it compatible with as many mods as I can, so it can be slotted into any pack or modded instance and be fully complete.\Alongside that, the textures are dynamically "grabbed" from the resources corresponding to the wood types, so this mod will function with any resource packs you use.\**Currently Under Developement**
