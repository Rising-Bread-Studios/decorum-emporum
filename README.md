**Decorum Emporium**
=======
This is a mod for [Minecraft: Java Edition 1.20.4](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us), using the [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net) mod-loader.<br \>The goal is simple, to add largely varying furniture while still maintaining a high quality mod. I intend to make it compatible with as many mods as I can, so it can be slotted into any pack or modded instance and be fully complete.<br \>Alongside that, the textures are dynamically "grabbed" from the resources corresponding to the wood types, so this mod will function with any resource packs you use.<br \>**Currently Under Developement**
