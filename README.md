**Decorum Emporum**
=======
This is a mod for [Minecraft: Java Edition 1.20.4](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us), using the [NeoForge](https://neoforged.net) mod-loader.  
  
The goal is simple, to add unique and high quality furniture. Alongside this, you can use any (acceptable) block texture for any furniture.  
My biggest problem with most furniture mods is compatibility with mods and/or modded blocks,  
And even when there is compatibility, having many instances of the same kind of furniture flooding JEI was always rough on my eyes and made searching for different furniture difficult.  
My solution was to make this, a furniture mod that can dynamically use any block texture.  

And no, Emporum isn't a real word, it's a slightly changed version of Emporium so the name would rhyme.  
**Currently Under Developement**

**Mod/pack Authors**
=======
The mod allows you to use any textures of blocks that have the ``#decorum_emporum:viable`` tag. It automatically searches through common tags, like ``#minecraft:planks`` and so on and adds those blocks to the tags. If you're a mod author and want to add built in compatibility for one of your blocks, but it doesn't fit in a common block tag category, just add it to the tag I previously stated. If you're a modpack author and want to make a block work with the furniture items, you can add blocks to the tag I previously stated through various methods (use [KubeJS](https://modrinth.com/mod/kubejs) or use datapacks).

**NOTICE**
=======
I'm just learning to code and know only a little java, if someone who isn't me or a friend happens to be looking at this, this will probably be under development for a bit.
